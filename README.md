## Image Spam/Ham Detection using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting spam and ham (non-spam) images using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. Spam images are those that contain irrelevant or unwanted content, often used for malicious purposes or unwanted advertisements, while ham images are legitimate and desirable.

### Features:
- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework, to train and deploy a custom image classification model.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Leveraging OpenCV, the project performs various preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and feature extraction to enhance model performance.
- **Dataset:** The model is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of both spam and ham images, allowing it to learn to distinguish between the two classes effectively.
- **Evaluation:** Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

### Usage:
1. **Installation:** Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Dataset Preparation:** Organize your dataset into spam and ham image folders.
3. **Model Training:** Use the provided Python script to train the model on your dataset.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model using test images and analyze performance metrics.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model for real-time image spam/ham detection in applications.

### Project Structure:
- **`train.py`:** Python script for training the image classification model.
- **`evaluate.py`:** Script to evaluate the model's performance on test images.
- **`requirements.txt`:** List of required Python packages for easy installation.
- **`data/`:** Directory containing the labeled dataset split into training and testing sets.
- **`models/`:** Location to save the trained machine learning models.

### Results:
- Achieved high accuracy and performance in distinguishing between spam and ham images.
- Robustness demonstrated through rigorous testing and evaluation on diverse datasets.
- Scalable and adaptable architecture suitable for integration into various applications and platforms.

### Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate deep learning techniques for improved feature extraction and classification.
- Explore advanced image augmentation methods to enhance model generalization.
- Develop a user-friendly interface or API for easy integration and usage by non-technical users.
